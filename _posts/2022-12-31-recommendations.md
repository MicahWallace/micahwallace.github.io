Over the years I have been asked many times about some of the gear I use and recommend.  Below is a list of items I will try to keep up to date.  If you have ideas for gear that is new or interesting, let me know.

## Software

[**1Password Password Manager**](https://bit.ly/2DaScpd)
If you don't know what a password manager is, its a secure place to store all your password like a safe, and if your not using one, you really should be.  1Password is one I have used for many years and works great across iOS, Android, Windows and Mac devices.  If you are a fellow Canadian, check out their .ca site for Canadian pricing.
>Make sure you use a strong master password on any password managers as this is what prevents a hacker from getting all your passwords in the rare event that they get a copy of your password vault.  Master passwords should be long (like a short sentence), and should be a password that you don't use anywhere else.

## Audio Books and Podcasts

Time is a valuable resource that you only get to spend once.  One of the ways I help myself stay up to date on technology and learn new things is by listening to podcasts and audio books while I drive.  Check out my blog post [Pulling Training Time Out of Thin Air](/posts/pulling-training-time-out-of-thin-air) for more on this.

For Podcasts, I love the [Podcast Addict](https://podcastaddict.com/app) app for Android.  Apple has a built in app that I use on occasion when I only have my Apple device.

## Network Gear

- [Ubiquiti](https://www.ui.com/)\
  I am a big fan of Ubiquiti network gear and have used this for a number of different charities, and run it in my home network.  The management console is really easy to use from a computer or mobile device and they make some great point to point wireless hardware if you are trying to run wifi to a shop or barn.
