Hello and welcome! I am an Information Technology Professional currently based out of South-Western Ontario, Canada. I have been working in the field since 2011 and continue to seek out new technology as well as broaden my experience and training. I have a passion for Information security and take every opportunity to learn and grow in the field.

My childhood was spent growing up on a farm which provided lots of opportunity to learn how to work hard, as well as to learn how to problem solve across a broad range. Being able to “Think outside the box” is a skill that is extremely valuable in IT and many problems faced on a daily basis require this skill to successfully solve.

Hello and welcome! As an Information Technology Professional based in South-Western Ontario, Canada, I have been working in the field since 2011 and am always seeking to broaden my experience and training. I have a strong passion for IT security and am dedicated to continuously learning and growing in this field.

Growing up on a rural farm taught me the value of hard work and the ability to think outside the box, which are both essential skills in IT. Many of the problems encountered in this field require creative thinking and the ability to find solutions from a variety of angles. I am always looking for new opportunities to hone these skills and provide the best possible service.
