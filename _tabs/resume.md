Hello and welcome! As an Information Technology Professional based in South-Western Ontario, Canada, I have been working in the field since 2011 and am always seeking to broaden my experience and training. I have a strong passion for IT security and am dedicated to continuously learning and growing in this field.

Growing up on a rural farm taught me the value of hard work and the ability to think outside the box, which are both essential skills in IT. Many of the problems encountered in this field require creative thinking and the ability to find solutions from a variety of angles. I am always looking for new opportunities to hone these skills and provide the best possible service.

## PERSONAL INTERESTS
